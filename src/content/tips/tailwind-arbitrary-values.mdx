import { Code } from "astro:components";

I use Tailwind for many of my side projects and even use it exclusively at work. One of the things I think is really cool about Tailwind is
it allows for very flexible styling all from within their JIT compiler. While they don't recommend doing this for everything, it's nice to know
how to do it when you need an escape hatch (this usually applies when you're dealing with CSS you do not control).

**Styling all immediate p tags within a div**

<Code
  lang="js"
  theme="github-dark"
  code={`<div class="[&>p]:font-bold">
  <span>Span 1</span>
  <p>Text 1</p>
  <p>Text 2</p>
</div>`}
/>

**Style everything within a div**

<Code
  lang="js"
  theme="github-dark"
  code={`<div class="[&>*]:bg-slate-900 [&>*]:text-slate-100">
  <span>Span 1</span>
  <p>Text 1</p>
  <p>Text 2</p>
</div>`}
/>

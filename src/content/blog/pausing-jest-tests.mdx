Ever found yourself wanting to hit the pause button on a unit test to check out what's happening with your component at a certain point? I know I have.

Let's take a look at a simple button component:

```jsx
import React from "react";

const Button = ({ onClick, disabled, children }) => (
  <button onClick={onClick} disabled={disabled}>
    {children}
  </button>
);

export default Button;
```

Now, say you want to test the disabled state of this button. Sounds easy, right? Well, not so fast. It gets a bit tricky when the onClick function might set disabled to true, and then flip it back to false at the end. So, how do we get around this?

Here's an example onClick function:

```jsx
const onClick = () => {
  setDisabled(true);
  // do some async stuff
  setDisabled(false);
};
```

Here's a neat trick: we can create a promise that won't resolve until we call resolve(). Then, we can use await to hold up the test until the promise is resolved.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { render, fireEvent, waitFor } from "@testing-library/react";
import Button from "./Button";

test("Button is disabled after click", async () => {
  let manualResolve;
  const onClick = jest.fn(
    () =>
      new Promise((resolve) => {
        manualResolve = resolve;
      }),
  );
  const { getByText } = render(<Button onClick={onClick}>Click me</Button>);
  const button = getByText("Click me");
  fireEvent.click(button);
  await waitFor(() => expect(button).toBeDisabled());

  manualResolve();
  await waitFor(() => expect(button).not.toBeDisabled());
});
```

And there you have it! A handy way to pause your tests and check out what's going on with your components.

Aligning with your company's values is essential for maintaining a happy work-life balance. But how do you ensure that your values stay aligned with those of your company, especially as both might evolve over time?

There are three broad categories I focus on to ensure my values and workplace values are aligned:

## Company Culture
* **Engineering Focus**: I need a company that prioritizes engineering. A strong engineering culture signifies a commitment to excellence and innovation, which is crucial for my professional satisfaction.
* **Values and Practices**: It's essential that the company's values resonate with my own, particularly around collaboration, transparency, and ongoing feedback.
* **Support for Growth**: I look for opportunities that offer personal and professional growth, including training, mentorship, and exposure to new technologies.

## Team Structure
* **Composition of the Team**: I want to be surrounded by smart and motivated individuals who challenge me and from whom I can learn.
* **Collaboration and Autonomy**: I prefer a balance where I can collaborate with my team yet have the autonomy to make my own decisions.
* **Leadership and Management Style**: The management style should support and facilitate professional development, not micromanage.

## The Product
* **Personal Connection**: I want to work on a product that I use and believe in. This connection motivates me and enhances my job satisfaction.
* **Impact and Value**: The product should deliver real value to its users. Building something that positively impacts others is immensely gratifying.

I often need to recursively get all files in a directory when writing node scripts. This is the solution I came up with. Not the most performant but it gets the job done.

```ts
// Recursively get all files in a directory.
// exclude test files and scss files since we don't want to check for dead assets in those.
async function getFilesRecursive(directoryPath: string) {
  let allFiles: string[] = [];

  const files = await readdir(directoryPath, { withFileTypes: true });

  for (const file of files) {
    const filePath = path.join(directoryPath, file.name);

    if (file.isDirectory()) {
      const subFiles = await getFilesRecursive(filePath);
      allFiles = allFiles.concat(subFiles);
    } else {
      if (!filePath.includes("test") && !filePath.includes(".scss")) {
        allFiles.push(filePath);
      }
    }
  }

  return allFiles;
}

const DIRECTORIES_TO_SCAN = ["dir1", "dir2", "dir3"];
const allFiles = await Promise.all(DIRECTORIES_TO_SCAN.map(getFilesRecursive));
```

- See [finding dead assets](https://www.connorlittleton.dev/blog/finding-dead-assets) for how to use this in a script to find dead assets. It also includes more info on how to read the contents use the list of files returned from this function.

## Vocabulary

- **Black holes:** Black holes are incredibly dense regions in space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. They form when massive stars collapse under their own gravity. Black holes come in different sizes, from small ones a few times more massive than the sun to supermassive ones found at the centers of galaxies.

- **Quarks**: Quarks are tiny building blocks of matter, smaller than atoms. They combine to form particles like protons and neutrons. There are six types, or "flavors," of quarks: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. Quarks are never found alone; they're always bound together in groups by a strong force, creating the particles that make up everything in the universe.

## Summary

"A Brief History of Time" by Stephen Hawking is a book that explores the evolution of human understanding of the universe. The book covers a range of topics from the early beliefs that Earth was the center of the universe to Eratosthenes' remarkable calculation of the Earth's circumference. It also delves into more modern theories, such as the Big Bang theory, Hubble's theory on the expansion of the universe, the force of relativity, and the speed of light. One of the most famous equations in science, E=mc^2, is also explained in the book. It states that the energy (E) of an object is equal to its mass (m) multiplied by the speed of light (c) squared. The book explains that an object's mass increases as it approaches the speed of light, which means it can never actually reach it. Overall, â€œA Brief History of Time" provides a comprehensive overview of the evolution of human understanding of the universe and the significant contributions made by various scientists throughout history.

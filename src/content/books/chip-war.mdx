The history of the integrated circuit (chip) is a fascinating tale that spans several decades and several countries. Starting with the space war in the 1960s, NASA's interest in these chips grew as they saw their potential to help mankind get to the moon. This interest, combined with space contracts, helped the chip market boom. Chips were first heavily supported by the government during wars in the late 1960s and then moved over to daily consumer use in computers as transistors got significantly smaller.

Today, computer chips are like the brains of our devices, be it smartphones or computers. They are tiny, super-smart pieces of silicon that can do lots of tasks quickly. The more transistors we can fit on a chip, the more powerful and capable our devices become. Moore’s Law, a prediction made by Gordon Moore, one of the founders of Intel, states that the number of tiny switches (transistors) we can fit on a computer chip will double about every two years. This helps make computers faster and more powerful over time!

The history of the chip is also closely linked with the names of Jack Kolby, Bob Noyce, and Fairchild, the American semiconductor company that played a crucial role in the early days of the semiconductor industry. Fairchild Semiconductor developed the first commercially practical integrated circuit, or microchip, which is a key component in electronic devices. This innovation laid the foundation for modern electronics and the computer industry.

However, the story of the chip is not just about American innovation and success. The Soviet Union tried copying chip-making, which did not pan out well because of how difficult chip-making is and Moore’s law. Japan copied American chip competitors, but had much higher success rates, leading to lots of competition for the US. In the 1980s, American companies like Intel and IBM were involved in joint ventures and collaborations with South Korean firms, helping shift the power from Japan, which was in the U.S’ favor.

Today, chips power almost everything we use, from phones to cars, and whoever wins the computing war, will have a great military advantage. The EUV technology gives us a huge advantage over China, and Taiwan's fabrication labs are a critical component of the chip industry, producing over 37% of the world's computing power. If Taiwan's fabs were knocked offline, it would take at least a half-decade to rebuild them, which would be catastrophic for the industry and the world.

## Appendix

- A **chip** usually refers to an integrated circuit (IC) or microchip. An integrated circuit is a tiny electronic device made out of a semiconductor material (often silicon) that can contain thousands to billions of transistors, resistors, and capacitors. These components are interconnected to perform specific functions, like processing information or storing data.
- A **semiconductor** is a material with electrical conductivity between a conductor (like metal) and an insulator (like rubber). Semiconductors are the foundation of electronic devices. Silicon is a commonly used semiconductor material.
- **Moore's Law** is a principle in computer science that states that the number of transistors on a microchip, and therefore the processing power of computers, tends to double approximately every two years. In simpler terms, it means that over time, computers become smaller, more powerful, and more efficient. This observation was made by Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, in 1965 and has been held for several decades, influencing the rapid advancement of technology.
